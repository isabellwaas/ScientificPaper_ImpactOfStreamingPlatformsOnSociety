# Introduction
This repository contains a scientific paper that I wrote in German during my Master's programme at Hof University of Applied Sciences in the lecture "Computer Science and Society". The paper explores the impact of digitalization on video and audio consumption as well as gaming. It begins by analyzing how consumer behaviour in these areas has evolved over the years. After that, streaming platforms are introduced, starting with a general explanation of streaming, followed by an overview of major providers in video-on-demand, music streaming, and cloud gaming, highlighting their features and content offerings. Furthermore, the paper examines the extent to which the use of these technologies is influencing society, addressing opportunities as well as challenges and risks. Finally, a conclusion is drawn and a perspective on future developments is provided.
