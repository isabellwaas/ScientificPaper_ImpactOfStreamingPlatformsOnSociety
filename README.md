# Introduction
This repository contains a scientific paper that I wrote in German during my Master's programme at Hof University of Applied Sciences in the lecture ‘Computer Science and Society’. It deals with digitalisation in the areas of video and audio consumption as well as gaming and looks at well-known streaming platforms. It also explains the extent to which the use of these technologies is influencing society, addressing opportunities as well as problems and risks.
